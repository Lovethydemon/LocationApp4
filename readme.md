toggleSwitch: This function is called when the "Use Custom Location" switch is toggled. It updates the useCustomLocation state to either true or false based on the previous value.

handleEnter: This function is called when the "Enter" button is pressed. It checks if an address or zip code is entered. If not, it shows an alert. It then requests location permission based on the platform (Android or iOS). If the permission is granted or if the custom location is not selected, it constructs a geocoding URL and fetches the location data from Google Maps API. If successful, it updates the latitude and longitude state and calls the spoofLocation function.

handleToggleLocation: This function is called when the "Use Custom Location" button is pressed. If the custom location is already enabled, it disables it and calls the restoreLocation function. If the custom location is not enabled, it checks the platform and requests location permission. If granted, it gets the current location and calls the spoofLocation function. It also constructs a geocoding URL and fetches the location data if an address is entered.

requestLocationPermissionAndroid: This function requests the location permission for Android using the request method from react-native-permissions package. It returns a promise that resolves to the permission status.

requestLocationPermissionIOS: This function requests the location permission for iOS using the request method from react-native-permissions package. It returns a promise that resolves to the permission status.

requestOverlayPermissionAndroid: This function is responsible for requesting the overlay permission for Android. It uses the react-native-open-settings package to open the overlay settings page. After the user grants or denies permission, you can check the result using the Settings.canDrawOverlays() method to verify the permission status.

requestOverlayPermissionIOS: This function is responsible for requesting the overlay permission for iOS. It uses the request method from react-native-permissions package to request the overlay permission. It checks the permission result and logs whether the permission was granted or denied.

getCurrentLocation: This function retrieves the current device location using the Geolocation.getCurrentPosition method. It takes an object with options as a parameter, such as enabling high accuracy and setting a timeout. It returns a promise that resolves to the location object containing latitude and longitude. If an error occurs, it handles different types of LocationError and logs the appropriate error message.

cancelLocationRequest and cancelLocationRequestAndroid: These functions are placeholders for canceling location requests on iOS and Android, respectively. You can implement them if needed.

useEffect: This hook is used to check and request location permissions on app startup. It calls the checkLocationPermission function and updates the permissionGranted, defaultLatitude, and defaultLongitude states based on the permission status and the current location.

spoofLocation: This function is responsible for implementing location spoofing based on the given latitude and longitude. It checks the platform and can be implemented separately for Android and iOS to set mock or spoofed locations.

restoreLocation: This function is responsible for restoring the original device location. It can be implemented separately for Android and iOS to disable mock location mode or revert any changes made to location data APIs or system components.

handleShowLocation: This function is called when the "Show Location" button is pressed. If the latitude and longitude are already available, it shows an alert with the current location. If not, it requests location permission on Android and gets the current location. On iOS, it directly gets the current location.

The code renders a view with various UI components such as text inputs, buttons, and a switch. It utilizes the GooglePlacesAutocomplete component from the react-native-google-places-autocomplete package for entering addresses. It displays the current location and allows users to enter a custom location or use the device's current location.
